# PG SQL Syntax

The `./pg.source.json` file contains the full list of PostgreSQL keywords as
defined in [Appendix C. SQL Key
Words](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html) of
the PostgreSQL documentation. These are applied on top of the existing SQL mode
grammer highlighting that ships with VS Code. Additional keywords can be added
to this list as they are added to the PostgreSQL documentation.
